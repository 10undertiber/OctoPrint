OctoPrint is a registered trademark of Mundo Reader, S.L. (hereinafter, Mundo Reader). 

# 1. Use of the brand name 

Mundo Reader owns all the rights pertaining to the OctoPrint brand ("brand" shall be 
taken to mean both the brand name and/or logo, together or separately) and is the only 
entity that is legally entitled to use it. However, as an active member of the 3D printing 
community, Mundo Reader voluntarily allows third parties (whether individuals or 
companies) to include the brand name on their packaging, websites and the 
accompanying material for their products and services in order to indicate that these are 
compatible with OctoPrint. 

In this respect, and in order to make it clear that, although the product or service in 
question is compatible with OctoPrint, it is not supported by or officially associated with 
OctoPrint or Mundo Reader, the aforementioned third parties must meet the following 
conditions when using the brand name: 

a) The words "product compatible with" or "can be used with" must be placed 
alongside the OctoPrint logo. 

b) The text "OctoPrint is a registered trademark of Mundo Reader, S.L." must be 
placed alongside the OctoPrint logo.

c) If the logo is used in an application or on a website, it must be hyperlinked to the 
URL octoprint.org.

d) The OctoPrint branding cannot be larger, positioned more prominently or stand 
out more than the name of the product itself, the brand to which said product 
belongs or the name of the company that owns it.

The OctoPrint brand may only be used free of charge for products and services that are 
also free of charge for their users. Individuals or companies that wish to use the brand for 
products or services of a for-profit nature must request express permission from Mundo 
Reader, which shall have the right to stipulate the terms and conditions for said use or to 
refuse the request.

# 2. Limitations to the use of the brand name

The OctoPrint brand name may not be used:

a) To give the false impression that a product or service is supported by or in any 
way associated with OctoPrint or Mundo Reader. 

b) To indicate compatibility with OctoPrint when this is not entirely the case. The 
product or service must be fully compatible with OctoPrint, not partially.

c) To link a product or service to OctoPrint in order to benefit from OctoPrintâ€™s 
reputation.  

d) In relation to products or services that are illegal or contain violent or explicit 
content. 

# 3. Use of the logo

The OctoPrint logo must be reproduced without altering any of its characteristics 
(colour, size relationship or perspective) and must appear sharp, not pixelated or 
deformed. 

# 4. Unfair use

"Unfair use" of the brand name is defined as use which seeks to imply that the product or 
service in question has some kind of relationship to OctoPrint or Mundo Reader. Such 
uses include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a) Using the brand name as part of a trading name, logo or domain name.

b) Using trading names that include the prefix "Octo" for the sole purpose of 
giving the impression that the product or service in question is related to 
OctoPrint.

c) Using the corporate colours or typeface of OctoPrint.

d) Using logos that are similar to, or variations of, the official logo of OctoPrint. 

# 5. Use of the brand name in promotional material

The manufacture, sale or distribution of promotional products that bear the OctoPrint 
brand name is strictly prohibited. Such products include, but are not limited to, clothing, 
accessories, decorative items, printed materials and products of a technical nature. Only 
Mundo Reader and any third parties to which it has granted express authorisation may 
use the OctoPrint brand name for the aforementioned purposes.

# 6. Legal action

Mundo Reader reserves the right to take legal action in order to prevent an individual or 
company from continuing to use the OctoPrint brand name if they are using it in a way 
that violates any of these General Conditions or if, in general, it considers said use to 
impact upon or enter into conflict with any of its intellectual-property rights.
