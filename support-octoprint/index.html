<h3>Hi! I'm <a href="">Gina Häußge</a>, the creator and main developer of OctoPrint. Thank you for following this link!</h3>
<p>
    As you might imagine, <strong>working on OctoPrint takes a lot of time and effort</strong>. The development of new functionality itself
    plus maintenance, bug fixing, testing, release preparations, reviews of contributed code and such alone is already a
    <strong>full time job when done right</strong>, and that even leaves out other coding unrelated tasks like writing documentation,
    community management, server administration etc.
</p>
<p>
    Don't get me wrong, <strong>I really love doing this work</strong>, and I want to continue doing it! But I can't manage this de facto
    full time job next to an actual one. My work on OctoPrint used to be fully backed by a single sponsor, but this is not
    the case any longer. So now I'm asking for your help to <strong>allow me to stay involved with OctoPrint as much as I am now!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can <strong>support OctoPrint's development</strong> by <a href="{{ site.patreon }}" target="_blank">becoming a patron on Patreon</a>
    or <a href="{{ site.paypal }}" target="_blank">making a one-time contribution on Paypal</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that <strong>becoming a patron on <a href="{{ site.patreon }}">Patreon</a>
    allows me to plan ahead better</strong>. Patreon also works through PayPal, you can cancel at any time, and on top of
    that you get access to some nifty perks.
